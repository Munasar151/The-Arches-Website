		<h4>Nadia Kaur
		- Learning Developer, IT
		<br>
		&#128231; kaur.n@dlc.org.uk
		</h4>
		<p>My role as an educator and the need to keep learning is very important to me. I taught for ten years, three years I have been teaching Adult Learners, which is incredibly rewarding and humbling. I too was an Adult Learner; I studied for an M.A. in Computing and Education on a part time basis, juggling a busy job as well as keeping time to be there for my family.
		In my spare time I undertake school residencies using technology as a tool to energize children and unleash their creativity. I was recently involved with students setting up a business to print on to different materials designs that they had made. They successfully raised over £20,000.

		<h4>Martin Karror
		– trainer 
		<br>
		&#128231; king.m@dlc.org.uk
		</h4>
		<p>I joined the team in August 2019 to take over social media duties and build our new website, but my role has grown to include helping delivery of our IT courses. In a previous life I studied English at Edinburgh Napier, made short films, and self-published a novel, but working alongside all the amazing people at the center has been the most rewarding thing I’ve done.
In my spare time, at the centre I run a substance misuse education class and work alongside the educational services and NHS staff from Birmingham to develop a range of activities to promote learning on the topic.

		<h4>Reece Joseph
		– Facilities manager. 
		<br>
		&#128231; roomhire@dlc.org.uk
		</h4>
<p>My role is to manage the centre and the caretaking/cleaning team to ensure that the centre is opened and secure at all hours of the day. I also ensure that there is no risk to health and safety to myself, any employee/volunteer or members of the public who use our centre.  I am also in charge of the booking and maintenance of the facilities that we have to hire. I would be the main contact when you enquire about a booking.
